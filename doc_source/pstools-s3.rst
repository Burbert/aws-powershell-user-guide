In this section, we create a static website from PowerShell using |S3| and |CF|. In the process, we
demonstrate a number of common tasks with these services. This walkthrough is modeled after the
Getting Started Guide for :gsg-aws:`AWS Static Website Hosting <website-hosting-intro>`. which 
describes a similar process using the :console:`AWS Management Console <s3>`.

The commands shown here assume that you have set default credentials and a default region for your
PowerShell session. Therefore, credentials and regions are not included in the invocation of the
cmdlets.
